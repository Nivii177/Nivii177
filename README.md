## Hi there 👋      

Hi, I'm Nivindu and Welcome to my Github Profile!!

I’m a Software Engineering student at McMaster University passionate about building intelligent, real-time systems that merge AI, robotics, and software engineering. My work focuses on creating scalable, interactive platforms from digital twins for robotic arms and AI-driven health assistants to real-time meeting analysis systems powered by LLMs and speech recognition.

I lead software initiatives that integrate computer vision, embedded systems, and backend automation. I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and intelligence connecting sensors, algorithms, and visualization to build smarter, more autonomous systems.

Beyond technical execution, I have an entrepreneurial mindset, having built and marketed my own digital ventures that leverage cutting-edge AI and automation tools to help businesses grow. I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments where I can turn complex engineering challenges into impactful, human-centered solutions.

Always curious, always building and always looking for opportunities to create technology that learns, adapts, and makes a difference
